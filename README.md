# USART User Interface for PIC Development Board

This project was done as a lab assignment in the Advanced Digital Design course at Ferris State University. It uses asynchronous serial communication to provide a text-based user interface through which a user can utilize the devices on the Bulldog PIC++ development board. The development board was designed and built by Professor Robert Most at Ferris State University, featuring a PIC18F46K80 microcontroller and a variety of additional devices. The hardware used in this project is shown in the block diagram below.

The project was programmed in C using MPLAB X and compiled using Microchip's C18 compiler. Functions from the C18 compiler library were used to configure and use the PIC18's USART peripheral. The PIC18 uses USART to send serial data to a USB to serial converter, which provides USB connectivity to a host PC. The user interface is accessed via a serial terminal on the host PC.

After initializations, the program prompts the user for an input command and then polls the DataRdy1USART() function to wait until a character is received. If an invalid command is received, the user is reminded of available commands with the following message:

A switch case statement activates the required response when one of the valid commands is received:

### L - Display the current illuminance measurement from the light sensor
The voltage from the analog light sensor is read as an 8-bit value by the PIC18's A/D converter, converted to an illuminance value in lux, and printed via USART to the user.


### B - Enter new color and intensity for the BlinkM LED
The user is prompted to enter an R, G, or B to select a color for the LED.
  

* Display a user-entered byte value in binary on a row of eight LEDs
  * Eight GPIO pins used to control LEDs
* Turn a piezoelectric buzzer on or off
  * Buzzer driven by a 488Hz square wave generated by one of the PIC18's Capture/Compare/PWM modules in PWM mode
* Display a user-entered text string on an LCD
  * LCD containing SPLC782 LCD driver interfaced to PIC18 via 8-bit parallel interface
  * LCD functions accessed via pre-written assembly functions called from main C program
* Display the current temperature measurement from a temperature sensor
  * TC74 temperature sensor accessed via I2C
